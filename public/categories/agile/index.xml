      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-points-from-measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr&#34;&gt;Key Points from &amp;ldquo;Measure What Matters&amp;rdquo; by John Doerr:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to OKRs: The book introduces the concept of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), a goal-setting framework used by successful companies like Intel and Google. OKRs provide a clear structure for setting and achieving ambitious goals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Setting Ambitious Objectives: Doerr emphasizes the importance of setting challenging and inspiring objectives that align with the company&amp;rsquo;s vision and mission. Ambitious objectives push individuals and organizations to strive for greatness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Defining Key Results: Key Results are measurable milestones or outcomes that help track progress towards the objectives. Doerr explains how to define effective key results that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cascading OKRs: The book discusses how to cascade OKRs throughout the organization, ensuring alignment and coordination across teams and departments. It highlights the significance of transparency and collaboration in the OKR process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tracking and Reviewing Progress: Doerr stresses the importance of regularly tracking and reviewing OKR progress. He provides practical tips on conducting effective check-ins, ensuring accountability, and making adjustments when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learning from Failures: The author emphasizes that failures and setbacks are valuable opportunities for learning and improvement. He encourages a growth mindset and a culture that embraces experimentation and risk-taking.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OKRs in Practice: The book shares numerous real-world examples of companies that have successfully implemented OKRs, illustrating how the framework can drive organizational alignment, focus, and high-performance cultures.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OKRs Beyond Business: Doerr explores how OKRs can be applied beyond the business world, including in nonprofit organizations, education, and personal goal setting. He demonstrates how the framework can help individuals and teams achieve extraordinary results in any domain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Continuous Improvement: The book emphasizes that the OKR process is iterative and should be constantly refined based on feedback and learning. Doerr provides insights on overcoming common challenges and adapting OKRs to changing circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This book is a great read full of inspiring real-world examples and a guide to implementing the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) framework, emphasizing the importance of setting ambitious goals and measuring progress towards achieving them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure what a Story Discovery session is about this high level introduction might come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Userstories mostly come from a PO or the business stakeholders. However it&amp;rsquo;s extremely valuable to get the insights from the team as well. I always like to ask my devs the following: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;With the goal of “{Insert goal here}” in mind: what topics do YOU think we should put on the roadmap?&lt;/em&gt; What piece of code or error message in the logs has been bugging you but you did not have/get the time to improve it? What ‘neglected part’ do you think needs more attention, a better workflow, different config/setup, better logging, more monitoring etc…?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
