      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since the unofficial Life360 plugin for Homeassistant started to act spotty (API changes related to Cloudfare all the time that were no longer fun to try to keep up with) I have been looking for an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily the only thing I need to know is whether 1 or more person is &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;not_home&lt;/code&gt;. This I determine with a probably way too complex Node-RED if-this-then-that type of flow. As Homeassistant has this built-in it was actually quite easy to setup. There are a couple other services out there as well, but for some reason I trust Homeassistant more (than Life360, for sure) when it comes to sharing my data with a 3rd party&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
