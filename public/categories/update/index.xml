      <description>First I was a bit hesitant on upgrading to 6.x as 5.14 was working absolutely fine. And why fix it if it ain&amp;rsquo;t broken&amp;hellip; ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Then the Hook Up came out with an updated 3-part guide on how to setup and configure the Unifi network and I made the adjustments to move away from the WLAN overrides. I have to say I am not completely happy yet with the controller&amp;rsquo;s stability as it&amp;rsquo;s disconnecting quite a bit.</description>

      <title>Downgrade Unifi Controller from 6.0.xx to 5.14.23</title>

      <description>UPDATE 2/4/2021: I adjusted my configuration so that upgrading to 6.x would not cause any issues anymore. Read more on how to upgrade the Unifi Controller manually on your Raspberry Pi
 Please don&amp;rsquo;t update your Unifi controller to 6.0.xx You will lose a couple great features that might mess up your network. Especially if you used the setup guide by The Hook Up. Think your VLAN settings for your WLAN and WLAN override configurations.</description>

      <description>If you work in a company selling products digitally everyone needs to learn how to properly debug before reporting a bug/issue to the incident managers or the platform-/dev-team.
It happens way too often that a bug is sort of thrown over the fence. Reporter: &amp;ldquo;Hey Carlo, I cannot perform {INSERT ACTION HERE}, it&amp;rsquo;s not working as how I expected it to work, please investigate&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; OK&amp;hellip; now what?
Before I jump into &amp;lsquo;investigation-mode&amp;rsquo; I would need at the minimum the following questions answered:  The most important one of all is on Reproducability: can you tell me how I can reproduce it on my machine?</description>
