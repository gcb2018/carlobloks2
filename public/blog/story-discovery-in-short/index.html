And only after that is done we will start creating tickets - refine - plan in sprint - etc.\nThe end result of the session would be to work towards a backlog with topics of which we know and agree they add value and we can pick them up one-by-one in a period of a couple of months or whenever the devs have some space in their sprint as we also work on the topics coming from the business stakeholders.\n",
