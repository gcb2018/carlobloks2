The sheer desire to get ahead, solve problems and improve everyday. That&rsquo;s what drives me both in my personal and professional life. I like challenging the status quo and trying out completely new approaches.
From early on I have been curious and wanting to understand how things work and why. Always eager to learn something new and completely dive into the topic or taking it apart to see the inside and if I can get it to work again.">

I like challenging the status quo and trying out completely new approaches.\nFrom early on I have been curious and wanting to understand how things work and why. Always eager to learn something new and completely dive into the topic or taking it apart to see the inside and if I can get it to work again.\nThis is also visible in my career. I have a lot of experience with innovation projects and Agile development, both in websites and mobile \u0026 web applications. I’m a true ‘digital native’ and have experience with every single touchpoint of the user. Besides having a deep knowledge on all aspects that are part of being a proper Product Owner I can help answer questions like:\n‘How do I get users to my website’ (and are we getting the right users in the right touchpoints) ‘How do I make sure the user can do customer journey X \u0026 Y on my site/app’ (and how can we improve this experience) ‘How do we engage our users’ ‘How do we increase conversion’ ‘What’s happening in the back-end in system Z’ ‘How do we track \u0026 measure 123’ and so on. (Also do check my Resume for more details)\nIdeas often start small and people are always very good at turning those ideas into something really big. My strength lies in being able to cut those bigger conceptual ideas into smaller pieces that are realistic and deliverable on the short term. And, naturally, I can then communicate these smaller pieces towards the team members and experts who will help develop it.\nOf course you have to start with a solid plan, but I am someone who wants to get started quickly. I don’t like to waste time in endless meetings and creating plans on paper only. My goal is to quickly try something out, analyze it and get to work. If it doesn’t work we scrap it and we have learned a valuable lesson in a short period of time. If it does work: great, now improve!\nThat is why I like to work with and surround myself with what I call ‘makers’. Colleagues and experts who can deliver by themselves, who don’t sly away from picking up new things and are also eager to learning something new. Trying out a lot of things and quickly finding out what works and what doesn’t. I truly enjoy being a part of that process.\nCurious what others say about me?\nGet in touch Feel free to get in touch and drop me a line in the form below.\n",
