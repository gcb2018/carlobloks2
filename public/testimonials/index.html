They are also posted on my LinkedIn if you want proof ðŸ˜„\n Tobias Siebert Senior Software Developer at Allianz Global Digital Factory\n â€œCarlo is one of the rare product owners that combines a deep technological understanding with a clear product vision and strong communication skills. I worked with him in a very demanding environment for 2 years. During this time, his commitment and drive helped us to achieve our goal on time. He is able to understand often vague requirements from stakeholders and to figure out what their actual need is. By turning these into clear user stories, he ensures that all developers are able to work without that friction. During this process, he also uses his deep technical understanding. An important factor is also his ability to keep the team spirit up. Especially in situations with high delivery pressure. He truly is a real team-player that stands up for his team. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Carlo and would be delighted to work again with him in the future.\"\n  Des Field Corbett CIO Allianz Direct\n â€œAt Allianz Direct Carlo was able to bring a diverse group of technical and non technical people together in a high performing cohesive team. He did this by being the kind of guy you love working beside and inspiring others to be the same.\"\n  Konstantin Riedel Product Owner Digital Marketing Technology | Tribe Lead MarTech \u0026 Customer Communication @ Allianz Direct\n â€œCarloâ€™s rare mix of curiosity, knowledge in technology and scrum skills let him stand out as Product Owner. I had the pleasure to work with him in the past two years in a highly demanding environment. No matter how high the delivery pressure was Carlo managed to prioritise and keep the team spirit up. What I am most thankful about is that as a developer I could focus on my sprint goal, while Carlo was protecting me from the outside and solved impediments quickly. Thanks for always having an open ear and the feedback you gave me personally to grow.\"\n  Floris van den Berg Digital Copywriter / Content Designer / UX Writer a.i.\n â€œReally enjoyed working with Carlo. His enormous drive, curiosity and enthusiasm are contagious and had a very positive impact on the atmosphere and the performance of our team. He is a true motivator and a very good listener. I always saw him as our â€˜human shieldâ€™ - always protecting us, so that we could keep our focus. Truly a perfect Product Owner.\"\n  Anian Haager Shaping Customer Journeys at Allianz Direct\n â€œCarlo was a great asset to the team, fully motivated and eager to collaborate with other POs, Business or colleagues from our local markets. He is that kind of person, who is approaching topics with full commitment. During his work in the central platform team he was always keen to connect the various domains of digital product management (e.g. Technology, UX/UI, Conversion Optimization and Business) So, if you are looking for a person who takes ownership and is thriving for improvement, Carlo is the right person for you.\"\n  Alexander Csiba European Product Owner at Allianz Direct\n â€œCarlo and I worked as Product Owners of different work streams with lot of interdependencies in a very challenging environment. His customer focus and drive for innovation was always inspiring. Even under stressful situations keeping a level head, committed to deliver a product which adds real value. And additionally, probably most importantly, a great personality, iâ€™d be happy to work with anytime!\"\n  Anna Rita Melosu Business Analyst, Functional Lead Sopra Steria\n â€œI worked with Carlo for over 1 year in Allianz Direct. As a product owner, Carlo has demonstrated strong commitment to the project, driving the team to reach our goals in every sprint. He has very strong communication skills, a great ability to resolve conflicts, and is always willing to help the team by explaining the product in detail, translating concepts into simple and clear user stories. It was great working with him. Over this last year, we grew as professionals thanks to him, his collaboration and help with the other teams. His availability to answer our questions and resolve our concerns at any time made this experience unforgettable. Iâ€™m really greatful and look forward to working with Carlo again in the future.\"\n  Abhishek Agrawal Senior Developer at Allianz Global Digital Factory\n â€œI worked directly with Carlo. He served as the Product Owner of our team. He is one of the most sought after experienced professional I have ever come across in my career. He is really committed to the task at hand. He is great at managing the stakeholderâ€™s expectations along with making sure his team never feels burdened. He has a calm and a very positive demeanour which adds lot of value to the firm. Along with his sharp business analytical skills he also brings the technical know how of product development and helps development teams to understand technical requirements with ease. He is an instant asset to any team he joins. Sincerely recommended.\"\n  Jeroen Millenaar Digital Customer Experience Manager bij Cordstrap | Keeping the worldâ€™s cargo safe\n â€œWork hard, play hard is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Carlo. During my time at Allsecur we build and created a new way of working and website. The results were outstanding. Carlo is a proactive, responsible and passionate person with positive attitude and Italian temperament. He is a real teamplayer who gets things done, and certainly can get my full recommendation.\"\n ",
