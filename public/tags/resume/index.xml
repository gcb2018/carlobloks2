      <description>Digital Product Owner / Digital Experience Manager hi@carlobloks.com | LinkedIn | +31614873993
Curious what others say about me?
As a Digital Product Owner I have a 8+ year track record in leading and managing cross-functional Agile / Scrum teams in various startup and large corporate organisations on an international level.
I have a thorough understanding of the digital landscape - both technical &amp;amp; commercial - and my curiosity drives me to keep seeking continuously for opportunities that optimise and improve UI / UX and online sales as well as developing the most intuitive digital experiences.</description>
