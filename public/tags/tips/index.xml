      <description>If you are not sure what a Story Discovery session is about this high level introduction might come in handy.
Userstories mostly come from a PO or the business stakeholders. However it&amp;rsquo;s extremely valuable to get the insights from the team as well. I always like to ask my devs the following: &amp;ldquo;With the goal of ‚Äú{Insert goal here}‚Äù in mind: what topics do YOU think we should put on the roadmap?</description>

      <title>Upgrade Unifi Controller to 6.x</title>
      <link>https://www.carlobloks.com/blog/upgrade_unifi_controller/</link>

      <description>First I was a bit hesitant on upgrading to 6.x as 5.14 was working absolutely fine. And why fix it if it ain&amp;rsquo;t broken&amp;hellip; ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Then the Hook Up came out with an updated 3-part guide on how to setup and configure the Unifi network and I made the adjustments to move away from the WLAN overrides. I have to say I am not completely happy yet with the controller&amp;rsquo;s stability as it&amp;rsquo;s disconnecting quite a bit.</description>

      <title>Cold showers for 34 days</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot and not entirely sure why I am even contemplating this. Laurens from Bikkelhart told me he does this all the time and I have heard more people talking about the benefits of cold showering and/or swimming.
The science is not really conclusive yet on whether it actually works but so many people swear by it. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to kickstart your day and do wonders for your immune system.</description>

      <title>Manually upgrading Unifi firmware</title>
      <link>https://www.carlobloks.com/blog/manually-upgrading-unifi-firmware/</link>

      <description>So you might have tried upgrading your Unifi devices via the controller and for some reason it did not work. Usually this means that the download of the firmware-file failed and chances are big this happens for one of your Switches. In my usecase I am manually upgrading the US-8-60W.
First you download the latest .bin-file from the Downloads page. Make sure to put it in the Downloads-folder on your Macbook in order to follow the steps I have specified below, else you need aadjust accordingly.</description>

      <title>HomePod mini - Finally here</title>

      <description>4 Months of waiting I think they were announced somewhere in October and now 4 months later I finally got my hands on 2 HomePod minis. In short: they are absolutely great value for the money and I can really recommend them, especially if you are already deep in the &amp;lsquo;Apple ecosystem&amp;rsquo;.
After trying them out in different rooms (where they all sound great) I ended up putting them both in the living room &amp;amp; kitchen.</description>

      <title>Honk - a new fun messaging app</title>
      <link>https://www.carlobloks.com/blog/honk-messaging-app/</link>

      <description>Honk.me Floris shared with me this weird but fun new messaging app called Honk which is showing the message as it is being typed. Including the user making mistakes and deleting some characters and then fixing the mistake. Instead of a &amp;lsquo;Send&amp;rsquo;-button it shows a &amp;lsquo;Refresh&amp;rsquo;-button that deletes your message and you can start typing again. But before refreshing the receiver has already seen the message. At least&amp;hellip; if he has been paying attention.</description>

      <title>Downgrade Unifi Controller from 6.0.xx to 5.14.23</title>

      <description>UPDATE 2/4/2021: I adjusted my configuration so that upgrading to 6.x would not cause any issues anymore. Read more on how to upgrade the Unifi Controller manually on your Raspberry Pi
 Please don&amp;rsquo;t update your Unifi controller to 6.0.xx You will lose a couple great features that might mess up your network. Especially if you used the setup guide by The Hook Up. Think your VLAN settings for your WLAN and WLAN override configurations.</description>

      <title>Stop ads from entering your home using Pi-hole</title>
      <link>https://www.carlobloks.com/blog/pihole/</link>

      <description>I don‚Äôt like ads and I feel no shame in admitting I use a combination of ad-blockers (uBlock) and ‚Äòdo-not-track-me‚Äô-plugins (Ghostery &amp;amp; Blur) in Safari. Come on, be honest; who isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ On the other side: sites I like get whitelisted. Easy.
However with all these different devices in your household it gets a bit confusing and cumbersome to install ad-blockers on all your devices. How great would it be if you could block ads at your router?</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi ‚Äî What is this Pi-thing?</title>

      <description>What is the Raspberry Pi? Don‚Äôt get fooled by the size of this micro computer. It‚Äôs as small as a credit card and comes in at pnly ‚Ç¨40 (Raspberry Pi 3) but it‚Äôs powerful enough to output full HD video and can handle a myriad of other tasks you wouldn‚Äôt have thought were possible. It comes without all the usual bells and whistles and packs only the bare minimum. But you can easily expand the system to your liking.</description>
