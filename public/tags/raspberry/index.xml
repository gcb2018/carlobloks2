      <description>I donâ€™t like ads and I feel no shame in admitting I use a combination of ad-blockers (uBlock) and â€˜do-not-track-meâ€™-plugins (Ghostery &amp;amp; Blur) in Safari. Come on, be honest; who isnâ€™tâ€¦ On the other side: sites I like get whitelisted. Easy.
However with all these different devices in your household it gets a bit confusing and cumbersome to install ad-blockers on all your devices. How great would it be if you could block ads at your router?</description>

      <description>What is the Raspberry Pi? Donâ€™t get fooled by the size of this micro computer. Itâ€™s as small as a credit card and comes in at pnly â‚¬40 (Raspberry Pi 3) but itâ€™s powerful enough to output full HD video and can handle a myriad of other tasks you wouldnâ€™t have thought were possible. It comes without all the usual bells and whistles and packs only the bare minimum. But you can easily expand the system to your liking.</description>
