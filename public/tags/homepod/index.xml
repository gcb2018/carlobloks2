      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-months-of-waiting&#34;&gt;4 Months of waiting&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think they were announced somewhere in October and now 4 months later I finally got my hands on 2 HomePod minis. In short: they are absolutely great value for the money and I can really recommend them, especially if you are already deep in the &amp;lsquo;Apple ecosystem&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After trying them out in different rooms (where they all sound great) I ended up putting them both in the living room &amp;amp; kitchen. This is a 50m2 area and after adding 2 HomePods Originals next to the TV I felt I was missing great sound on the other side of the living room and in the kitchen. This setup gives the room a super nice experience as you hear the music coming from every direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
