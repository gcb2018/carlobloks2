      <description>4 Months of waiting I think they were announced somewhere in October and now 4 months later I finally got my hands on 2 HomePod minis. In short: they are absolutely great value for the money and I can really recommend them, especially if you are already deep in the &amp;lsquo;Apple ecosystem&amp;rsquo;.
After trying them out in different rooms (where they all sound great) I ended up putting them both in the living room &amp;amp; kitchen.</description>
