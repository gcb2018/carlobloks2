  "articleBody": "Digital Product Owner / Digital Experience Manager hi@carlobloks.com | LinkedIn | +31614873993\nI am currently not available as I am fully booked until July ‘26\nCurious what others say about me?\nFreelance Digital Product Owner with 14+ years of experience helping teams turn ideas into reliable, user-focused digital products.\nOver the years, I’ve led cross-functional Agile teams across industries and countries, always focused on creating products that make sense for both users and the business. Known for bridging the gap between strategy and technology, translating complex ideas into clear priorities and deliverables that move teams forward.\nI’m naturally curious and love understanding how things work, whether it’s the architecture behind a platform, the data driving a dashboard, or the small UX/UI tweaks that make a big difference. That curiosity keeps me exploring new tools and smarter ways of building products.\nAs my current assignment wraps up later this year, I’m starting to look ahead to new opportunities for early 2026. If your team values a pragmatic, tech-savvy Product Owner who enjoys connecting people, processes, and technology — I’d love to connect.\nHow I work As you can read in the About Me section I have the “sheer desire to get ahead, solve problems and improve everyday”. This you can clearly see in how I work as a Product Owner.\nI truly own the topic/product/journey end-2-end. It starts with knowing the relevant data and checking the dashboards/data daily. All the way to knowing all customer journeys and making sure we build \u0026 improve (e.g. with A/B-testing, UX Research) incrementally and monitoring the production assets.\nI also like to describe myself as a Technical PO as I am used to diving into the different tools myself. I know my way around all the tools/services used by the team and don’t shy away from diving in myself if it helps the team. For instance, in case of an incident I have no issues in opening up the monitoring \u0026 logging tools to see how we can solve the incident for the users. I feel it’s truly necessary for a PO to understand the tools the experts in the team work with to make sure I understand the possibilities and limitations.\nAt my last assignment My previous assignment I was booked by Omron Healthcare. Without diving too deep into the details: I’ve been supporting Omron as a Product Owner in the further development and automation of their multi-country platform in Salesforce (SFCC/SFSC/SFMC) as well as their omnichannel order management platform. Furthermore, I was fully involved in the automated E2E-tests setup as well as managing the Roadmap for the next 1-2 Qs to make sure the team works on the topics that deliver the most value to both users \u0026 business.\nBefore Omron Together with the experts in my team we have shaped the digital landscape of all operating entities within Allianz Direct (previously known as Allsecur NL). We have developed brand new harmonized digital experiences with the latest technologies and insights that are being used by countries like NL/DE/IT/ES.\nI was responsible for building and improving the website and the sales-funnels, including the external integrations.\nFrom the website UX/UI to the brand voice. From all documents to the omni-channel customer communication. From tracking \u0026 analytics to the DMP and Experience Manager. We implemented and optimized the entire Adobe suite to enable the 4 countries countries in achieving their goals.\nSkills \u0026 Tools \u0026 Interests Github / Jenkins / Kibana / Kafka Operatr / Grafana / Sketch / Adobe CC / Adobe Experience Manager / ElastAlert / Adobe Target / Final Cut X / Pixelmator / Blueconic / Node-RED / Zigbee2mqtt / LAKKA / RetroPie / Abstract / Postman / Hotjar / MySQL / Omnigraffle / Trello / Invision / Miro / Figma / Google \u0026 Adobe Analytics / Twilio / Wordpress / Whimsical / Lottie / Ryte / Crashlytics / iTunes Connect / Home Automation / Raspberry Pi / Home Assistant / Workflow Productivity / Notion / Slack / Teams / IoT / Jekyll / Netlify / HUGO / Visual Studio Code\nDownload Resume in PDF Work together?
