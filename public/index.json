[{"content":"When you\u0026rsquo;ve just purchased a new grinder there are a couple things you need to make sure of which for some reason is not mentioned in most reviews.\nFirst you need to season the burrs. This means putting at least a couple KGs of cheap oily beans through the grinder. I did 2 KGs on my DLC burrs before I noticed more consistency but will probably do another kilo. Different burrs need different amounts op seasoning it seems. The procedure here is simple: just keep on grinding on different settings and do it in 250gr batches to not overheat the grinder. Second. Make sure the burrs are aligned properly. Factory alignment might be ok-ish in most situations but you need to verify this yourself. The procedure here is a bit more finicky. You can follow Lance Hedrick\u0026rsquo;s tips in his burr alignment video. I was as lucky as he was: I only had to adjust it once (by adding two small pieces of foil in 1 layer), and test it twice before it was perfectly aligned. After doing these steps I noticed way better consistency in my shots as well as dialing in was easier as well.\nThese tips are for most flat-burr grinders, but in this particular case it\u0026rsquo;s for the df83v. The df83v thusfar seems to be a great bang for your buck grinder and with a few minor tweaks you can make sure to get the best out of it. You could ask yourself the question why on earth you\u0026rsquo;d need to tweak an +800$ grinder, but I guess that comes with the espresso rabbit-hole.\nBy the way, after unboxing there was a weird chemical smell as well that disappeared after a couple days (I did nothing to fix this).\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/blog/df83v-issues-fixed/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve just purchased a new grinder there are a couple things you need to make sure of which for some reason is not mentioned in most reviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst you need to \u003cem\u003eseason the burrs\u003c/em\u003e.

OKRs provide a clear structure for setting and achieving ambitious goals. Setting Ambitious Objectives: Doerr emphasizes the importance of setting challenging and inspiring objectives that align with the company\u0026rsquo;s vision and mission. Ambitious objectives push individuals and organizations to strive for greatness. Defining Key Results: Key Results are measurable milestones or outcomes that help track progress towards the objectives. Doerr explains how to define effective key results that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Cascading OKRs: The book discusses how to cascade OKRs throughout the organization, ensuring alignment and coordination across teams and departments. It highlights the significance of transparency and collaboration in the OKR process. Tracking and Reviewing Progress: Doerr stresses the importance of regularly tracking and reviewing OKR progress. He provides practical tips on conducting effective check-ins, ensuring accountability, and making adjustments when necessary. Learning from Failures: The author emphasizes that failures and setbacks are valuable opportunities for learning and improvement. He encourages a growth mindset and a culture that embraces experimentation and risk-taking. OKRs in Practice: The book shares numerous real-world examples of companies that have successfully implemented OKRs, illustrating how the framework can drive organizational alignment, focus, and high-performance cultures. OKRs Beyond Business: Doerr explores how OKRs can be applied beyond the business world, including in nonprofit organizations, education, and personal goal setting. He demonstrates how the framework can help individuals and teams achieve extraordinary results in any domain. Continuous Improvement: The book emphasizes that the OKR process is iterative and should be constantly refined based on feedback and learning. Doerr provides insights on overcoming common challenges and adapting OKRs to changing circumstances.

That\u0026rsquo;s what drives me both in my personal and professional life.

Always eager to learn something new and completely dive into the topic or taking it apart to see the inside and if I can get it to work again.\nThis is also visible in my career. I have a lot of experience with innovation projects and Agile development, both in websites and mobile \u0026amp; web applications. I\u0026rsquo;m a true \u0026lsquo;digital native\u0026rsquo; and have experience with every single touchpoint of the user. Besides having a deep knowledge on all aspects that are part of being a proper Product Owner I can help answer questions like:\n\u0026lsquo;How do I get users to my website\u0026rsquo; (and are we getting the right users in the right touchpoints) \u0026lsquo;How do I make sure the user can do customer journey X \u0026amp; Y on my site/app\u0026rsquo; (and how can we improve this experience) \u0026lsquo;How do we engage our users\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;How do we increase conversion\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening in the back-end in system Z\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;How do we track \u0026amp; measure 123\u0026rsquo; and so on. (Also do check my Resume for more details)\nIdeas often start small and people are always very good at turning those ideas into something really big. My strength lies in being able to cut those bigger conceptual ideas into smaller pieces that are realistic and deliverable on the short term. And, naturally, I can then communicate these smaller pieces towards the team members and experts who will help develop it.\nOf course you have to start with a solid plan, but I am someone who wants to get started quickly. I don\u0026rsquo;t like to waste time in endless meetings and creating plans on paper only. My goal is to quickly try something out, analyze it and get to work. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work we scrap it and we have learned a valuable lesson in a short period of time. If it does work: great, now improve!\nThat is why I like to work with and surround myself with what I call \u0026lsquo;makers\u0026rsquo;. Colleagues and experts who can deliver by themselves, who don\u0026rsquo;t sly away from picking up new things and are also eager to learning something new.

Known for bridging the gap between strategy and technology, translating complex ideas into clear priorities and deliverables that move teams forward.\nI’m naturally curious and love understanding how things work, whether it’s the architecture behind a platform, the data driving a dashboard, or the small UX/UI tweaks that make a big difference. That curiosity keeps me exploring new tools and smarter ways of building products.\nAs my current assignment wraps up later this year, I’m starting to look ahead to new opportunities for early 2026. If your team values a pragmatic, tech-savvy Product Owner who enjoys connecting people, processes, and technology — I’d love to connect.\nHow I work As you can read in the About Me section I have the \u0026ldquo;sheer desire to get ahead, solve problems and improve everyday\u0026rdquo;. This you can clearly see in how I work as a Product Owner.\nI truly own the topic/product/journey end-2-end. It starts with knowing the relevant data and checking the dashboards/data daily. All the way to knowing all customer journeys and making sure we build \u0026amp; improve (e.g. with A/B-testing, UX Research) incrementally and monitoring the production assets.\nI also like to describe myself as a Technical PO as I am used to diving into the different tools myself. I know my way around all the tools/services used by the team and don\u0026rsquo;t shy away from diving in myself if it helps the team. For instance, in case of an incident I have no issues in opening up the monitoring \u0026amp; logging tools to see how we can solve the incident for the users. I feel it\u0026rsquo;s truly necessary for a PO to understand the tools the experts in the team work with to make sure I understand the possibilities and limitations.\nAt my last assignment My previous assignment I was booked by Omron Healthcare. Without diving too deep into the details: I\u0026rsquo;ve been supporting Omron as a Product Owner in the further development and automation of their multi-country platform in Salesforce (SFCC/SFSC/SFMC) as well as their omnichannel order management platform. Furthermore, I was fully involved in the automated E2E-tests setup as well as managing the Roadmap for the next 1-2 Qs to make sure the team works on the topics that deliver the most value to both users \u0026amp; business.\nBefore Omron Together with the experts in my team we have shaped the digital landscape of all operating entities within Allianz Direct (previously known as Allsecur NL).
