Just some high level description (e.g: \u0026lsquo;Solve {whatever} ERROR from the logs\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Clean up a certain CSS\u0026rsquo;). What I like to do is to share a Miro link so everyone can store their ideas there already if they want.\nDuring the session each and everyone of the team will get some time to put their topics (on a high level) on the Miro board and we will all have the time to explain in short what it is about and why they think it makes sense to pick it up. We will also have time to then briefly discuss \u0026amp; ask questions.\nThen we will t-shirtsize (S/M/L) -\u0026gt; group -\u0026gt; vote -\u0026gt; prioritize the topics. And only after that is done we will start creating tickets -\u0026gt; refine -\u0026gt; plan in sprint -\u0026gt; etc.\nThe end result of the session would be to work towards a backlog with topics of which we know and agree they add value and we can pick them up one-by-one in a period of a couple of months or whenever the devs have some space in their sprint as we also work on the topics coming from the business stakeholders.\n","permalink":"https://www.carlobloks.com/blog/story-discovery-in-short/","summary":"If you are not sure what a Story Discovery session is about this high level introduction might come in handy.\nUserstories mostly come from a PO or the business stakeholders.

And do you want to control those cheap 433MHz sensors/lights/switches/weather stations/sockets/etc you can find on eBay, Aliexpress or wherever? Maybe you already have some COCO (KlikAanKlikUit) switches or dimmers installed in your house? The missing link that connects all this to the web? ‚Äì\u0026gt; The RFXtrx433E tranceiver. Make sure you buy the 433E-version. You can buy one here\n4. Apple Watch series 3 To be fair: I don‚Äôt own one yet. The only reason this is high on this list is because I want one and I am going to show this list to my wife üòâ (Received it üöÄ)\n3. Xiaomi / Aqara sensors Again, this is for your home automation fantasies. Xiaomi produces dirt cheap and high-quality sensors that use the Zigbee-protocol but be connected via the (also cheap) Xiaomi Gateway to for example Domoticz, or simply control it via the app. If you order them now they might arrive in time.\n2. Raspberry Pi 3 I wrote en entire blogpost on what you can do with a Raspberry Pi and multiple others about what I have done with it. One of the most awesome things is it runs Domoticz as my main home automation hub: need I say more? Buy it here\n1. AirPods My number 1 for 2017 has got to be the Apple AirPods. I am proud owner of a set since January 2017 and I can honestly say I have used them almost every single day. I use them mostly for listening to podcasts, watching Youtube, calling (they are in my ears probably 50% of my work day) and working out while listening to Spotify. If you are an audiophile there are options in the market for sure that offer you a better sound quality. I am not. At this price point and with the convenience they have brought me I can not tell you enough: buy a pair and you will love them. Buy them here\nThis ends my Gift Guide for 2017.

How great would it be if you could block ads at your router? If you could stop ads from even entering your house? Not only will you stop seeing ads. Your network-speeds will increase because it is no longer trying to load or all these ads.\nIf you have a Raspberry Pi you can easily do this. You can setup the Raspberry Pi as a DNS and direct all your traffic trough the Rasberry Pi. Sounds difficult but it is not. The guys from Pi-hole have developed a network-wide ad-blocking application. Via a simple and single curl command you are ready to go.\ncurl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash\nFirst SSH into your Pi, paste the above command in the Terminal and Pi-hole will install. The only thing left is configuring your router so all traffic is routed through your Pi. 10 minutes tops.\nPi-hole even comes with a GUI Admin Console so you can easily blacklist and/or whitelist ad-domains.

Don‚Äôt get fooled by the size of this micro computer. It‚Äôs as small as a credit card and comes in at pnly ‚Ç¨40 (Raspberry Pi 3) but it‚Äôs powerful enough to output full HD video and can handle a myriad of other tasks you wouldn‚Äôt have thought were possible. It comes without all the usual bells and whistles and packs only the bare minimum. But you can easily expand the system to your liking. Plug in an external keyboard, mouse and monitor (via USB and HDMI) and you‚Äôre good to go. It has its own Linux-based OS and once you have installed it on your Raspberry Pi you have a graphical user interface (GUI) just as you might recognise from Windows and macOS. Some people even use it as their primary computer as it comes with open source software like a text-editor, FMS and games.\nYou don‚Äôt necessarily need to add peripherals to the Raspberry Pi. You can access and control it via SSH from a remote device. From macOS you can use the Terminal and Windows users can use an app called Putty.\nAll in all it‚Äôs real fun to play around with this tiny device. Even if you wouldn‚Äôt call yourself a developer / programmer there are numerous sites and fora that explain how things are done. These websites can help you out if you are stuck.\nFor now I have installed Raspbian (Jessie) on the Raspberry Pi as its main OS. I have also installed Domoticz as well as WordPress, Amazon Voice Service (Alexa) and Owncloud.\n","permalink":"https://www.carlobloks.com/blog/raspberry-pi/","summary":"What is the Raspberry Pi?

That\u0026rsquo;s what drives me both in my personal and professional life. I like challenging the status quo and trying out completely new approaches.\nFrom early on I have been curious and wanting to understand how things work and why. Always eager to learn something new and completely dive into the topic or taking it apart to see the inside and if I can get it to work again.\nThis is also visible in my career. I have a lot of experience with innovation projects and Agile development, both in websites and mobile \u0026amp; web applications. I\u0026rsquo;m a true \u0026lsquo;digital native\u0026rsquo; and have experience with every single touchpoint of the user. Besides having a deep knowledge on all aspects that are part of being a proper Product Owner I can help answer questions like:\n \u0026lsquo;How do I get users to my website\u0026rsquo; (and are we getting the right users in the right touchpoints) \u0026lsquo;How do I make sure the user can do customer journey X \u0026amp; Y on my site/app\u0026rsquo; (and how can we improve this experience) \u0026lsquo;How do we engage our users\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;How do we increase conversion\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening in the back-end in system Z\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;How do we track \u0026amp; measure 123\u0026rsquo; and so on.  (Also do check my Resume for more details)\nIdeas often start small and people are always very good at turning those ideas into something really big. My strength lies in being able to cut those bigger conceptual ideas into smaller pieces that are realistic and deliverable on the short term. And, naturally, I can then communicate these smaller pieces towards the team members and experts who will help develop it.\nOf course you have to start with a solid plan, but I am someone who wants to get started quickly. I don\u0026rsquo;t like to waste time in endless meetings and creating plans on paper only. My goal is to quickly try something out, analyze it and get to work. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work we scrap it and we have learned a valuable lesson in a short period of time. If it does work: great, now improve!\nThat is why I like to work with and surround myself with what I call \u0026lsquo;makers\u0026rsquo;. Colleagues who can deliver by themselves, who don\u0026rsquo;t sly away from picking up new things and are also eager to learning something new. Trying out a lot of things and quickly finding out what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t.

I know my way around all the tools/services used by the team and don\u0026rsquo;t shy away from diving in myself if it helps the team.

I worked with him in a very demanding environment for 2 years. During this time, his commitment and drive helped us to achieve our goal on time. He is able to understand often vague requirements from stakeholders and to figure out what their actual need is. By turning these into clear user stories, he ensures that all developers are able to work without that friction. During this process, he also uses his deep technical understanding. An important factor is also his ability to keep the team spirit up. Especially in situations with high delivery pressure. He truly is a real team-player that stands up for his team. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Carlo and would be delighted to work again with him in the future.\u0026quot;\n  Des Field Corbett CIO Allianz Direct\n \u0026ldquo;At Allianz Direct Carlo was able to bring a diverse group of technical and non technical people together in a high performing cohesive team.
