### Tobias Siebert 
Senior Software Developer at Allianz Global Digital Factory

> _"Carlo is one of the rare product owners that combines a deep technological understanding with a clear product vision and strong communication skills. I worked with him in a very demanding environment for 2 years. During this time, his commitment and drive helped us to achieve our goal on time. He is able to understand often vague requirements from stakeholders and to figure out what their actual need is. By turning these into clear user stories, he ensures that all developers are able to work without that friction. During this process, he also uses his deep technical understanding. An important factor is also his ability to keep the team spirit up. Especially in situations with high delivery pressure. He truly is a real team-player that stands up for his team. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Carlo and would be delighted to work again with him in the future."_
