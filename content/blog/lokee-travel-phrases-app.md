When I travel I like trying to speak with locals, even if it's just a few words. A "buenos días", an "obrigado", or ordering a coffee in the local language. Nothing fancy, just the basics. The problem is I'm terrible at remembering these things. I'd look them up, forget them 10 minutes later, and then feel awkward pointing at menus again.

I tried a bunch of translation apps but they're either overkill (I don't need to learn verb conjugations on vacation) or just give you text without any idea how to actually pronounce it. And Google Translate in a crowded market with bad reception? Not fun.

So I built [Lokee](https://www.lokeeapp.com).

It's a simple iOS app with travel phrases organized by situation: greetings, food & drinks, directions, hotel stuff, emergencies, that kind of thing. Each phrase has audio so you can hear how it's supposed to sound. You can favorite the ones you use most and they stay available offline.

No accounts, no subscriptions, no ads, and no personal data collected. There's a 3-day free trial to try everything out. After that you can grab a travel pass (7 or 30 days) or just get lifetime access if you travel often.

Right now it supports Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Greek, Danish, Papiamento, Chinese, and Thai. I'll add more languages over time based on where I'm heading next (or based on feedback).

You can find it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6756304796) - if you have ideas or run into issues, just reach out at hi@lokeeapp.com. I'm genuinely curious what works and what doesn't.
