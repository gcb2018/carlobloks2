Working remote is awesome, especially if you can use proper tools (üñïüèº Teams -> üòç Slack). However, not everyone is used to working with these tools and there is definitely some [etiquette](https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack) involved here. 

The most annoying one is receiving a message just saying: "Hi Carlo" and then nothing... Now my brain goes: shit what does he/she want? If I answer will I be sucked into some unimportant topic I don't want to deal with right now or does he/she simply want help? This is wasting both of our time. So please, just spit it out in the first sentence: "Hi Carlo, can you please help me with X" 

This ancient [blogpost](https://www.nohello.com) from 2013 is one of the earlier mentions on this topic and there are a [newer](https://nohello.net/en/) ones too. There is even a custom emoji you can add to Slack.
