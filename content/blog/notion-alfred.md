## Powerful combination of 2 great apps

According to the [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) usage statics on average I have used Alfred 16.5 times a day. A staggering 24874 times since 31st December 2016 (The day I got this Macbook). Since I am now fully into [Notion](/blog/trying-out-notion/) I though it would be great if both powerful apps can be combined. Turns out - as always - I am not the first one with this thought and with [this great explanation](https://github.com/wrjlewis/notion-search-alfred-workflow/blob/master/README.md) it was super easy to setup.
