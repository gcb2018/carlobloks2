## Intro

Optimizing the overall platform performance is a cross-disciplinary effort. It includes targeting the right audience on the essential channels with the right content (SEA / Adwords). It's about improving the connection between what the audience sees off-platform and what they encounter once landing on the platform (Campaign / Traffic management). Lastly it's about the quality and completeness of all the content we serve on the platform (SEO / Content & Web Management).

Improving these areas will **eventually** show improvements in the various metrics & KPIs described below. Eventually, as not all metrics are under our direct control (e.g. SEO). 

It also entails a strict steering and managing of the Paid channels. Performance needs to be checked on a weekly basis and campaigns need to be adjusted when necessary. Events need to be earmarked in Google Analytics for future analysis.
