## 4 Months of waiting

I think they were announced somewhere in October and now 4 months later I finally got my hands on 2 HomePod minis. In short: they are absolutely great value for the money and I can really recommend them, especially if you are already deep in the 'Apple ecosystem'.

After trying them out in different rooms (where they all sound great) I ended up putting them both in the living room & kitchen. This is a 50m2 area and after adding 2 HomePods Originals next to the TV I felt I was missing great sound on the other side of the living room and in the kitchen. This setup gives the room a super nice experience as you hear the music coming from every direction. 

What's interesting is that these HomePods are actually tiny, like soft-ball tiny, a small grapefruit. And the sound it produces is really quite impressive. For â‚¬99... not bad...

They are currently out of stock but I definitely plan on getting more for upstairs (2x bedrooms, office and perhaps even the bathroom) for a true multi-room listening experience.

You can get them at [Cyberport](https://www.cyberport.de/tools/search-results.html?autosuggest=true&q=Apple+HomePod+mini+spacegrau), [Gravis](https://www.gravis.de/Katalog/Apple-Produkte/Apple-HomePod/Apple-HomePod-mini-Lautsprecher-space-grau/p/140825) or [fnac](https://www.fnac.com/SearchResult/ResultList.aspx?SCat=0%211&Search=homepod+mini&sft=1&sa=1) if you are lucky.
