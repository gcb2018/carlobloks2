## What is Notion and why try it out?
[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) has been around for a couple years already. It's an all-in-one workspace where you can write, plan, collaborate and get organized - _"it allows you to take notes, add tasks, manage projects etc"_. It's also one of the fastest growing productivity apps available on many platforms and this of course sparked my interests. 

The common idea is a bit that it's very easy nowadays to 'collect stuff' but it's getting increasingly more difficult to find it so you can actually do something with it. Your notes / to-do's / plans / ideas / 'read laters' or 'watch laters' / wishlist / etc are scattered over many apps and sites and Notion tries to solve this and integrate all your workflows into this one hub.

I have been playing around with it for a bit already and there are truly loads of tutorials, guides and templates you can lookup on YouTube or in their own [wiki](https://www.notion.so/wikis). It's really awesome thusfar to dive into it and you can really set it up as you wish.

For my workflow I hope it will eventually replace the following apps: Notes / IA Writer / Things3 / MS To Do / Safari Reading List / Wishlists / Saved articles on Reddit / Watch later's on YT

Let's see how that turns out ü§ôüèº
