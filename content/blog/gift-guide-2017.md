## Looking for a gift for one of your â€˜semi-nerdyâ€™ family members or friends? Or maybe even your spouse. Consider any of these gifts below.

### 5\. RFXcom

Are you already running Domoticz on a Raspberry Pi? And do you want to control those cheap 433MHz sensors/lights/switches/weather stations/sockets/etc you can find on eBay, Aliexpress or wherever? Maybe you already have some COCO (KlikAanKlikUit) switches or dimmers installed in your house? The missing link that connects all this to the web? â€“> The RFXtrx433E tranceiver. Make sure you buy the 433E-version. [You can buy one here](http://www.rfxcom.com/store/Transceivers/14103)

### 4\. Apple Watch series 3

To be fair: I donâ€™t own one yet. The only reason this is high on this list is because I want one and I am going to show this list to my wife ðŸ˜‰ (Received it ðŸš€)

### 3\. Xiaomi / Aqara sensors

Again, this is for your home automation fantasies. Xiaomi produces dirt cheap and high-quality sensors that use the Zigbee-protocol but be connected via the (also cheap) Xiaomi Gateway to for example Domoticz, or simply control it via the app. If you [order them](https://nl.aliexpress.com/store/top-rated-products/1161084.html?origin=n&SortType=orders_desc&SearchText=smart) now they might arrive in time.

### 2\. Raspberry Pi 3

I wrote en entire blogpost on what you can [do with a Raspberry Pi](/blog/raspberry-pi) and multiple others about [what I have done with it](http://carlobloks.com/blog/). One of the most awesome things is it runs [Domoticz](http://www.domoticz.com/) as my main home automation hub: need I say more? [Buy it here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)

### 1\. AirPods

My number 1 for 2017 has got to be the Apple AirPods. I am proud owner of a set since January 2017 and I can honestly say I have used them almost every single day. I use them mostly for listening to podcasts, watching Youtube, calling (they are in my ears probably 50% of my work day) and working out while listening to Spotify. If you are an audiophile there are options in the market for sure that offer you a better sound quality. I am not. At this price point and with the convenience they have brought me I can not tell you enough: buy a pair and you will love them. [Buy them here](https://www.apple.com/airpods/)
