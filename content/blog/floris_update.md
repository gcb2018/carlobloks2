## Honk.me

Floris shared with me this weird but fun new messaging app called [Honk](https://honk.me) which is showing the message as it is being typed. Including the user making mistakes and deleting some characters and then fixing the mistake. Instead of a 'Send'-button it shows a 'Refresh'-button that deletes your message and you can start typing again. But before refreshing the receiver has already seen the message. At least... if he has been paying attention. Else it's gone forever ðŸ’¨

You can also HONK a contact which feels quite similar to the classic 'nudge' you could send on earlier platforms like Hyves.nl.

If you want to try it out you can add me on @carlobloks ðŸ”„
