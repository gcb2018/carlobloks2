I'm an idiot and not entirely sure why I am even contemplating this. Laurens from [Bikkelhart](https://www.bikkelhart.com) told me he does this all the time and I have heard more people talking about the benefits of cold showering and/or swimming.

The science is [not really conclusive](https://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/alleen-als-het-ijs-en-ijskoud-is~bdc3f046/) yet on whether it actually works but so many people swear by it. It's supposed to kickstart your day and do wonders for your immune system. There is loads of content to find on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cold+showers+wim+hof&sp=CAM%253D) of people who have tried it and say they will never stop doing it...

Perhaps I am just going to try it to see if I can 'conquer this challenge'. And if - on top of that - I feel better that would be really awesome.. ðŸ¤ž
