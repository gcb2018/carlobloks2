From early on I have been curious and wanting to understand how things work and why. Always eager to learn new things and taking things apart to see the inside and if I can get it to work again. 

I have a lot of experience with innovation projects and Agile development, both in websites and mobile & web applications. I'm a true 'digital native' and have experience with every single touchpoint of the user. I can help answer questions like:
* 'How do I get users to my website'
* 'How do I make sure the user can do X & Y on my site/app'
* 'What's happening in the background in system Z'
* 'How do we track & measure 123?' and so on.

Ideas often start small and people are always very good at turning those ideas into something really big. My strength lies in being able to cut those bigger conceptual ideas into smaller pieces that are realistic and deliverable on the short term. And, naturally, I can then communicate this towards the team members and experts who will help develop it.

Of course you have to start from a solid plan, but I am someone who wants to get started quickly. I don't like to waste time in endless meetings and creating plans on paper only. My goal is to quickly try something out, analyze it and get to work. If it doesn't work we scrap it and we have learned a valuable lesson in a short time period. If it does work: great, now improve! 

That is why I like to work with what I call 'makers'. Colleagues who can deliver themselves, who don't sly away from picking up new things and are also eager to learning something new. Trying out a lot of things and quickly finding out what works and what doesn't. I truly enjoy being a part of that process.

Curious what others [say about me](/testimonials/)?
